# RowdyHacks-2023
General Track Submission for RowdyHacks 2023

-----------------------------------------------
Overview:
-----------------------------------------------
The Amazing Frog Butler, Le Frog, is here to 
answer all your questions! He may not have a 
great memory, but his personality and style 
creates a charm you will admire to have in a 
butler. Ask away, and your personal assistant
will try his best to guide you in the right 
direction!

-----------------------------------------------
Process:
-----------------------------------------------
I started by drawing drafts based on the 
concept of a digital assistant of some kind. 
Due to my lack of knowledge of training AI,
I utilized ChatGPT as a foundation to create 
custom responses for the user's custom 
questions. I wanted to also include a voice
to seem more personal, with an addition of 
mouth movement to mimic live speaking. In my 
knowledge of coding languages, Python is a
comfortable language, though the concepts I 
implemented throughout the code was unknown to
me. I found that Python included modules for 
text-to-speech as well as grabbing images on 
a separate window, so I went forward to coding 
the design.
 
I developed communication with ChatGPT first, 
because that was the basis of the assistant. 
Afterwards, I moved to creating a interactable
window for the user to ask the medium 
questions. After making the text readable, I 
completed the text-to-speech variable with a
Google Translate library on Python then went
to complete including an image to show up on 
the window, then move to seem like its 
speaking, albeit very robotic.

-----------------------------------------------
Future Development:
-----------------------------------------------
Currently, I am using the Free Trial API key
to make the requests to OpenAI, so we are 
limited in terms of how many times we can ask
the program a question. What I would like to 
do in the future would include an iterative
history to include in the statement (as each 
question is a new session by previous 
experiements) so that "Le Frog" has a sort of 
artifical memory. Other components to add would
be utilizing VoxBox for other voices, such as 
a "Kermit" voice or one with a 
distinguished accent to fit the butler theme,
and finding a way to make "Le Frog" "speak" 
his words through syllable timing and/or
mouth shapes for different sounds.

-----------------------------------------------
What I Learned:
-----------------------------------------------
I learned that AI is stronger than what I
thought it was, being a force that not only 
makes decisions based on human preference and
experience, but can play a "role", of which is
observed when the code asks OpenAI to act as a
"frog butler." Personal assistents may become
more personal in a shorter amount of time than
most anticipate, and they may become a part
of our daily lives as quick as IPhones did 
more than 10 years ago. 
I also learned a great deal about 
troubleshooting and the power of talking it 
out in a group, as some of the problems I had 
were simply solved when I talked it through 
with another person. 
Overall, I had a great experience working on
the project, and happy that I had the 
opportunity to do it during RowdyHacks,
surrounded by many brilliant people that 
support the growth of a hacker mindset, 
providing an great atmosphere to create.
